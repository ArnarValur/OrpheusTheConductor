# Project Workflow — Strict (TDD)

> Full test-driven development workflow with coverage gates.
> Red → Green → Refactor on every task. No exceptions.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `tracks.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in the **Tech Stack** section of `project-context.md` *before* implementation. Architecturally significant changes (those satisfying the three-criteria ADR test: hard to reverse, surprising without context, real trade-off) additionally warrant an ADR in `conductor/adr/` — surface as a candidate at `/grill`, `/new-track`, or `/checkpoint` time.
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution

---

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict 11-step lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `tracks.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Edit `tracks.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase

5. **Refactor (Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing external behavior
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example:

   ```bash
   # Python
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   # Node.js
   CI=true npx vitest --coverage
   # Go
   go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
   ```

   **Gate: >80% coverage for new code.** Do not proceed if coverage is below threshold.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update the **Tech Stack** section of `project-context.md` with the new design
   - Add a dated note explaining the change (user-edited; no command writes to `project-context.md` post-init per S3)
   - If the change is architecturally significant (three-criteria ADR test), surface it as an ADR candidate at the next `/grill`, `/new-track`, or `/checkpoint`
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task
   - Commit with a clear, concise message following conventional commits format
   - Example: `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **9.1:** Get commit hash: `git log -1 --format="%H"`
   - **9.2:** Draft note content — task name, summary of changes, list of created/modified files, and the core "why"
   - **9.3:** Attach note:

     ```bash
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

10. **Record Task Completion in Plan:**
    - **10.1:** In `tracks.md`, update the completed task from `[~]` to `[x]` and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash
    - **10.2:** Write the updated content back to `tracks.md`

11. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - Stage the modified `tracks.md`
    - Commit: `conductor(tracks): Mark task '<task name>' as complete`

---

## Phase Completion — Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** Executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `tracks.md`.

1. **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and checkpointing has begun

2. **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
   - **2.1:** Read `tracks.md` to find the previous phase's checkpoint SHA. If none, scope is all changes since first commit
   - **2.2:** List changed files: `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD`
   - **2.3:** For each code file (exclude `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`, etc.), verify a corresponding test file exists. If missing, create one matching the project's test naming convention and style

3. **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
   - Announce the exact shell command before running
   - Execute the test command
   - If tests fail: inform user, attempt fix (max 2 attempts). If still failing, **stop and ask for guidance**

4. **Propose Manual Verification Plan:**
   - Analyze `project-context.md` (Product Definition + Guidelines sections), `prd.md` (when present, for current scope), and `tracks.md` to determine the phase's user-facing goals
   - Generate step-by-step verification instructions with specific commands and expected outcomes

   **Frontend example:**

   ```
   Manual Verification Steps:
   1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
   2. Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
   3. Confirm: The new user profile page displays correctly
   ```

   **Backend example:**

   ```
   Manual Verification Steps:
   1. Ensure the server is running
   2. Execute: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users -d '{"name": "test"}'`
   3. Confirm: JSON response with status `201 Created`
   ```

5. **Await User Feedback:**
   - Ask: "Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback."
   - **PAUSE.** Do not proceed without explicit confirmation

6. **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
   - Stage all changes (or create empty commit if no changes)
   - Commit: `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`

7. **Attach Verification Report via Git Notes:**
   - **7.1:** Draft report including automated test command, manual steps, and user confirmation
   - **7.2:** Attach to checkpoint commit via `git notes add`

8. **Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
   - **8.1:** Get checkpoint commit hash: `git log -1 --format="%H"`
   - **8.2:** In `tracks.md`, append `[checkpoint: <7-char-sha>]` to the completed phase heading
   - **8.3:** Write updated `tracks.md`

9. **Commit Plan Update:**
   - Stage `tracks.md`
   - Commit: `conductor(tracks): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`

10. **Announce Completion:** Inform user that the phase is complete with checkpoint and verification report attached

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add remember me functionality"
git commit -m "fix(posts): Correct excerpt generation for short posts"
git commit -m "test(comments): Add tests for emoji reaction limits"
git commit -m "conductor(tracks): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete"
