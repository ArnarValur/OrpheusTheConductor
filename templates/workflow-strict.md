# Project Workflow — Strict (TDD)

> Full test-driven development workflow with coverage gates.
> Red → Green → Refactor on every task. No exceptions.

## The Two Laws

These bind every write in this conductor. Everything else in this file is convention; these are law.

1. **One fact, one home.** Live truth lives in `pulse.md`. A session's story is told once, in `relay.md`. Lessons live in the permanent rules files (`agent-rules/`). Decisions live in ADRs (`adr/`) or track-plan D-numbers. Never retell — point.
2. **A ruling binds only when it lands in a repo file.** Agent memory is a cache and conversation is vapor. If a rule, decision, or lesson is not in a repo file, it does not exist.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work is tracked in a track — its `plan.md` holds the tasks; `tracks.md` holds one line per track
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in the **Tech Stack** section of `project-context.md` *before* implementation. Architecturally significant changes (those satisfying the three-criteria ADR test: hard to reverse, surprising without context, real trade-off) additionally warrant an ADR in `conductor/adr/` — propose it in-session; approved ADRs are written at `/checkpoint`.
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution

---

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict 11-step lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from the active track's `plan.md`, in order

2. **Mark In Progress:** In the track's `plan.md`, change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase

5. **Refactor (Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing external behavior
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example:

   ```bash
   # Python
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   # Node.js
   CI=true npx vitest --coverage
   # Go
   go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
   ```

   **Gate: >80% coverage for new code.** Do not proceed if coverage is below threshold.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update the **Tech Stack** section of `project-context.md` with the new design
   - Add a dated note explaining the change (user-edited — no command writes to `project-context.md` post-init)
   - If the change is architecturally significant (three-criteria ADR test), propose it as an ADR in-session; it is written at `/checkpoint` once approved
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task
   - Commit with a clear, concise message following conventional commits format
   - Example: `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`

9. **Record Task Completion in Plan:**
    - **9.1:** In the track's `plan.md`, update the completed task from `[~]` to `[x]` and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash
    - **9.2:** Write the updated content back to the track's `plan.md`

10. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - Stage the modified `plan.md`
    - Commit: `conductor(tracks): Mark task '<task name>' as complete`

---

## Phase Completion — Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** Executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in the track's `plan.md`.

1. **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and checkpointing has begun

2. **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
   - **2.1:** Read the track's `plan.md` to find the previous phase's checkpoint SHA. If none, scope is all changes since first commit
   - **2.2:** List changed files: `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD`
   - **2.3:** For each code file (exclude `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`, etc.), verify a corresponding test file exists. If missing, create one matching the project's test naming convention and style

3. **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
   - Announce the exact shell command before running
   - Execute the test command
   - If tests fail: inform user, attempt fix (max 2 attempts). If still failing, **stop and ask for guidance**

4. **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
   - Stage all changes (or create empty commit if no changes)
   - Commit: `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`

5. **Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
   - **5.1:** Get checkpoint commit hash: `git log -1 --format="%H"`
   - **5.2:** In the track's `plan.md`, append `[checkpoint: <7-char-sha>]` to the completed phase heading
   - **5.3:** Write the updated `plan.md`

6. **Commit Plan Update:**
   - Stage the track's `plan.md`
   - Commit: `conductor(tracks): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`

7. **Announce Completion:** Tell the user the phase is done — no sign-off step; the user speaks up if something is wrong

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented
- [ ] Type safety is enforced
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

---

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `conductor`: Conductor file updates (plan, checkpoint, tracks)

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add remember me functionality"
git commit -m "fix(posts): Correct excerpt generation for short posts"
git commit -m "test(comments): Add tests for emoji reaction limits"
git commit -m "conductor(tracks): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete"
```

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. All code implemented to specification
2. Unit tests written and passing (Red → Green → Refactor completed)
3. Code coverage meets project requirements (>80%)
4. Documentation complete (if applicable)
5. Code passes all configured linting and static analysis checks
6. Works on mobile (if applicable)
7. Implementation notes added to the track's `plan.md`
8. Changes committed with proper message
